## Data Structure
- **Definition:** A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
  
- **Complexity Analysis:** Involves analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms implemented using various data structures.
  
- **Asymptotic Analysis:** Analyzing the performance of algorithms as the input size approaches infinity.
  
- **Big O:** A notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity.
  
- **Memory Leaks:** Occur when a program allocates memory but fails to release it when no longer needed, leading to memory exhaustion.
  
- **Linear vs. Non-linear Data Structures:** Linear data structures organize data in a sequential manner, while non-linear data structures organize data in a hierarchical manner.

## Linked List
- **Definition:** A linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element points to the next element.
  
- **Singly Linked List:** Each element contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next element in the sequence.
  
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each element contains data and references to both the next and previous elements.

## Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search:** Iteratively searches for a target value in a list, examining each element in order until the target is found or the list is exhausted.
  
- **Binary Search:** Requires the list to be sorted. It compares the target value to the middle element of the list and continues narrowing down the search space until the target is found or the list is empty.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity of Linear Search:** O(n) - linear time complexity.
  
- **Time Complexity of Binary Search:** O(log n) - logarithmic time complexity.

## Applications of Linked List
- Used in implementations of stacks, queues, and hash tables.
  
- Memory allocation and deallocation in operating systems.
  
- Representing polynomials in algebraic expressions.

## Array vs. Linked List
- Arrays offer constant-time access to elements but have a fixed size and may require resizing.
  
- Linked lists allow for dynamic memory allocation and insertion/deletion at any position but have slower access times and require more memory due to storing references.

## Recursion
- **Definition:** A programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem.
  
- **Example Applications:** Recursive factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, tree traversal.

## 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms Mastery 

🚀 Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms. It's a part of my learning journey to master these essential concepts in computer science. 💻✨ 

## Data Structures 

🌐 Stack: A linear data structure following LIFO (Last In First Out) order. 
📊 Queue: A linear data structure following FIFO (First In First Out) order. 
📥📤 Linked List: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object. 
🔗 Arrays: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 
📏 Strings: A sequence of characters. 
🔤 Maps: A collection of key-value pairs. 
🗺️ Sets: A collection of distinct objects. 
🔢 Graphs: A collection of nodes and edges. 
🌐 Hash Tables: A data structure implementing an associative array. 
🗃️ Tries: A type of search tree used for storing dynamic sets or associative arrays where the keys are usually strings.

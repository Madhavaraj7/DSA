📚 Data Structures and Algorithms Mastery 🚀
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms. It's a part of my learning journey to master these essential concepts in computer science. 💻✨

Data Structures 🌐
Stack: A linear data structure following LIFO (Last In First Out) order. 📊
Queue: A linear data structure following FIFO (First In First Out) order. 📥📤
Linked List: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object. 🔗
Arrays: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 📏
Strings: A sequence of characters. 🔤
Maps: A collection of key-value pairs. 🗺️
Sets: A collection of distinct objects. 🔢
Graphs: A collection of nodes and edges. 🌐
Hash Tables: A data structure implementing an associative array. 🗃️
Tries: A type of search tree used for storing dynamic sets or associative arrays where the keys are usually strings. 🌲
